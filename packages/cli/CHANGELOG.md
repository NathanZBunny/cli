# @bunny.net/cli

## 0.18.1

### Patch Changes

- [#237](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/237) [`0f0bd10`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/0f0bd10a067cee1b493024da834c9aa33f0b2140) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - `bunny sites` detects Blazor WebAssembly projects and never downloads a framework CLI that isn't installed

- [#236](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/236) [`c9ab1eb`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/c9ab1eb5f465bdf9d472c0a256b6154095d2740c) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - Fix reading an empty `.env` value (like `BUNNY_DATABASE_URL=`) as the next line's contents

- [#86](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/86) [`7eb2a74`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/7eb2a7409b8cbc626970b08568f7e63641ccc340) Thanks [@burstw0w](https://github.com/burstw0w)! - Add an experimental, hidden `bunny pz` command for managing pull zones

- [#241](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/241) [`9a743f5`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/9a743f54b3ac0beef06dd129680870f13cdf5595) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - Publish `@bunny.net/framework-detector`: the framework presets, framework and package manager detection, and the GitHub Actions workflow behind `bunny sites`, as a dependency-free package the dashboard and the Sites control plane share with the CLI. `bunny sites deploy` now hashes content the same way on every machine and in the dashboard, whatever the locale; a site's next content deploy after upgrading gets a new content hash once, so an unchanged folder is published again rather than skipped.

- [#233](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/233) [`f228638`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/f22863899b2e2ad369c27eb67bab929617e6931b) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - `bunny sites create --from-zone` imports an existing storage zone and its pull zone as a site, keeping its hostnames and serving it unchanged until the first deploy

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- [#225](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/225) [`e783640`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/e78364078a21e9285ea0dfdbf3932ad2bef18c34) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - db create offers a schema template and applies it as the database's first migration

### Patch Changes

- [#201](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/201) [`814eae6`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/814eae6ab32023b02d16bf546234eee63e7d539c) Thanks [@mohammed-io](https://github.com/mohammed-io)! - `bunny login` now ends with a tip for enabling shell completion in zsh, bash, and fish

- [#229](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/229) [`5b69aa6`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/5b69aa60480b2cfa01519b071c8b9076f06328b1) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - db create offers eleven schema templates, including booking, CRM, feature flags, and forms

- [#231](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/231) [`265a661`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/265a6614b19f3eb3fdd3b6bdcb66a7076dceb84e) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - Ship macOS binaries with a valid signature; CLI releases also publish SHA256SUMS, which install.sh verifies

- [#230](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/230) [`a4dec48`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/a4dec48dfafd2a46f4008ad758d2b91ef51c8046) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - Publish under the MIT license: every package now declares `license` and ships a LICENSE file

- [#219](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/219) [`9c9c57a`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/9c9c57a5cbe6d16298adcd32ed195a309d07f2b3) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - `bunny registries add`/`update` gain `--type` and derive it from `--server` (ghcr.io and docker.io need one), `--output json` returns a normalized registry shape, and API keys and registry credentials are redacted from `--verbose` request traces

- [#219](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/219) [`9c9c57a`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/9c9c57a5cbe6d16298adcd32ed195a309d07f2b3) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - `bunny registries` moves under `bunny apps registries`, where those registries are used, leaving `bunny registry` unambiguously the bunny.net registry you push to; the list gains a `Source` column separating your connections from bunny.net's public pull-throughs and its own registry, which can no longer be updated or removed by mistake; `registry list` and `registry tags` move onto the tools layer and `list` returns a plain array of repository names under `--output json`

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- [#214](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/214) [`df79bb9`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/df79bb968187fc3d0b5e3ae201b7c00ee6ae8dc9) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - `bunny sites deploy` serves single-page apps on refresh (`sites.spa`, detected from the framework) and uses a root `404.html` as the not-found page.

### Patch Changes

- [#221](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/221) [`8cac91e`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/8cac91edab4a1ab931943cfb22ff2acd6056b99c) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - Fewer manual steps between creating a resource and using it: adding a custom domain (sites, scripts, storage) whose nameservers already point at bunny.net but has no Bunny DNS zone in the account now offers to create the zone and add the record, instead of printing a CNAME you have nowhere to set; `scripts env push` (and `env set --from-file`) sends a local `.env` to an Edge Script, picking which variables to push and which are secrets; storage `.env` writes now include `BUNNY_STORAGE_CDN_URL` and a lowercased `BUNNY_STORAGE_REGION` that the S3 endpoint accepts; `db create --mode auto|single|manual` answers the region prompt from the command line; `env set` asks whether a prompted value is a secret even when the name was given; and the lifecycle verbs follow one rule, with every previous spelling kept as an alias: `create` makes a new resource and `delete` destroys it (`storage zones create`/`delete`, `dns zone create`/`delete`), while `add` attaches something to an existing resource and `remove` takes it away again (`sandbox url remove`, `sandbox env remove`).

- [#218](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/218) [`919ef47`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/919ef477da75c44e904e0916d073f415bab64405) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - Friendlier handling of small mistakes: "Did you mean" for top-level typos, one-line help pointers (JSON under `--output json`), a clean error for unknown profiles and non-numeric IDs, a login hint naming the credential source on every 401, a warning when `BUNNY_API_KEY` is set instead of `BUNNYNET_API_KEY`, a confirmation on `config profile delete`, and timeouts on the update check. `delete` now also answers to `rm`, a bare `bunny -v` prints the version, and help lists a command's own flags ahead of the global ones.

- [#209](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/209) [`ffc2fb3`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/ffc2fb364a2963c9782e377d62e78725fe503834) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - `bunny sites migrate` moves a site created with the earlier Edge Script router onto the edge-rule architecture in place, keeping its domain, certificate, and deploy history.

## 0.16.1

### Patch Changes

- [#206](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/206) [`d6b68a7`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/d6b68a7d0f058d035171f10e0398428f5b6410da) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - Harden `@bunny.net/database-client`: `batch()` takes a `mode`, guards its ROLLBACK, rejects transaction statements, and reports the failing statement as `error.batchIndex`; invalid `timeout` values and malformed responses become `DatabaseError`, transport errors keep their `cause`, integer-valued doubles past 2^53 bind as REAL, and `db.sql` carries a row type. Migrations apply with `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`.

- [#204](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/204) [`a00a867`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/a00a867b210a72730338d719aa8c83a5bb644ae7) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - `bunny skills install` now ships references for Bunny Storage (`bunny storage` zones, files, connection credentials, custom domains) and for querying a database from application code with `@bunny.net/database-client`.

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- [#200](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/200) [`6ede231`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/6ede231cf2d720e51a90840c40d62c7d84157f07) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - Sites are now served by pull zone edge rules instead of a router Edge Script (HTML revalidates in browsers on every view, deploy dirs are blocked at the edge), and `sites deploy --deploy-id` lets a deploy carry your own release identifier

### Patch Changes

- [#198](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/198) [`2c98438`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/2c984387baa082d13dbf6d2a67a19cc594756ecb) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - Keep existing container env vars on `apps deploy` and `apps push` when bunny.jsonc has no env block

- [#196](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/196) [`7e93515`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/7e9351586caa6bfc59b0b01d66126c7905604858) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - Add `bunny sites create --tier hdd|ssd` to pick the storage tier

## 0.15.1

### Patch Changes

- [#184](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/184) [`4565456`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/4565456964b467869d834ad4d910d137424aebee) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - fix(sites): `sites ci init` names the repository secret `BUNNYNET_API_KEY`, matching the environment variable the CLI reads, pins the generated workflow to a `deploy-site` action tag that exists.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- [#136](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/136) [`5e61ab6`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/5e61ab68dac1b14be16748560bdde8b623551c80) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - feat(db): `bunny db migrations create/list/apply` runs numbered `.sql` files in `migrations/` (or `drizzle/`) once each, tracked in `__bunny_migrations`; `--pattern` supports nested ORM layouts while checksum drift and out-of-order files block unsafe applies unless `--allow-drift` is explicit; migration commands show the credential-free database target; `splitStatements` keeps `CREATE TRIGGER` bodies intact, supports every SQLite quote form, drops comments, and rejects truncated SQL; `db shell`, `db studio`, and `db migrations apply` now honour an explicit database ID over `.env` credentials, require encrypted hosted database URLs regardless of token source, and refuse to send an ambient or generated token to a different hostname or service port

- [#182](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/182) [`4616f46`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/4616f463fa800f2eea7ef1a7b5286ede2d298466) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - feat(sites): `bunny sites deploy` now publishes straight to production. One command puts your site live: no `--production` flag to remember, no publish prompt on a fresh site, and no half-deployed state to reason about. Deploys stay immutable under their own ID, so `sites deployments publish` still rolls back to any earlier one instantly without re-uploading a byte, and `ci init` writes a leaner workflow that goes live on every push to `main` (plus `workflow_dispatch` for on-demand redeploys) and records each run in the repository's Environments. This drops the per-deploy preview URL

### Patch Changes

- [#183](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/183) [`7b6105b`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/7b6105b85fc7e80b29e235ebc5e83dae41170d4e) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - fix: resolve open code scanning alerts; markdown table cells escape backslashes before pipes so a value containing `\|` no longer splits the cell, the SQL statement splitter counts block depth with a linear scan instead of a regex that rescanned from every offset on a run of unclosed `[`, `sites ci` detects a GitHub origin by remote host instead of a substring match, `database-rest` returns a generic 500 and hands the real error to an `onError` hook (wired to the studio's logger) instead of putting it in the response body, and the CI, template-upload, and install-script-upload workflows pin `GITHUB_TOKEN` to `contents: read`

- [#154](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/154) [`294ae07`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/294ae07086ab44ad47e55405a68f6e9397e005a4) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - Add `@bunny.net/database-client`, a zero-dependency server-side SQL client for Bunny Database that runs on Edge Scripting, Bun, and Node, and move `db shell`, `db studio`, and `db migrations` onto it in place of `@libsql/client`.

- [#173](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/173) [`5f88add`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/5f88add71dc3f75e0e105d47f42a5f2e4baa574a) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - fix(core): prompts no longer spin at 100% CPU forever when run without a terminal (CI, cron, `< /dev/null`); prompts now require an interactive terminal, so input prompts and destructive confirmations fail fast with exit 1 and a hint naming the flag to pass (`--force` or the value flag), offer-style prompts decline and continue, and piped prompt answers are no longer supported (pass flags instead)

- [#177](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/177) [`c71f358`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/c71f358e8c34e3e1936b5d418bfbcd4e9ddf3ef1) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - fix(storage): correct file listing, path joining, root deletes. `storage files remove` now fails fast instead of prompting when nobody can answer. Also match the dashboard's region sets per tier and S3 support

## 0.14.1

### Patch Changes

- [#174](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/174) [`e2a7110`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/e2a7110e71d81e1e53243653ca994412f5751db2) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - fix(skills): always write .agents/skills, refuse home installs

- [#176](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/176) [`040b6fd`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/040b6fd9e94ec50d08b7ac811d930321fc5d5804) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - Refuse project agent skill installs into the filesystem root

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- [#160](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/160) [`c95da7e`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/c95da7ecab6eb0814ae640bdc7771df88cde1872) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - feat(skills): `bunny skills install` (aliases: `add`, `update`) installs the bunny agent skill so AI coding tools know how to use the CLI; a project install upserts a marked block into AGENTS.md and, when the project uses Claude Code, writes the full skill with references to `.claude/skills/bunny-cli/`, while `--global` writes it to `~/.agents/skills/bunny-cli/` (the cross-tool directory) and `~/.claude/skills/bunny-cli/` for every project; `bunny skills remove` (aliases: `rm`, `uninstall`) undoes either scope; the installed content is the shipped `skills/bunny-cli/` skill embedded at build time

- [#170](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/170) [`9338eb0`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/9338eb0cbfb705f194c00f882dfa0dec81061027) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - feat(auth): `bunny login` detects when no browser is usable (SSH, CI, containers, no display) and offers an API key instead; `--output json` prints the result as one object

- [#167](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/167) [`2757151`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/2757151535b00d1e4d4d9bcff535420c3d94c17c) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - feat(sandbox): breaking - `bunny sandbox cp` moves to `bunny sandbox files cp`, next to `bunny sandbox files list`, so every file command lives in one namespace; the old path no longer copies anything and instead errors with the exact replacement command to run, and `defineCommand` gains `hidden` for stubs like it

- [#161](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/161) [`80115c0`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/80115c01f50b9c0e87b63b12e7f276471902cb81) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - feat(skills): `bunny login` offers a one-time global agent-skill install after authenticating (interactive runs only, skipped when already installed), and install.sh now points at `bunny skills install --global`

### Patch Changes

- [#156](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/156) [`3dff411`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/3dff411468a9bf3602dfd66f0bdc0a9f2cbf851e) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - anycast endpoints now send the `iPv4` IP protocol version documented by the Magic Containers API

- [#156](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/156) [`3dff411`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/3dff411468a9bf3602dfd66f0bdc0a9f2cbf851e) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - point documentation links at bunny.net/docs, including the Scriptable DNS link that had gone dead

- [#149](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/149) [`19aec86`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/19aec86d94bff28a96d7649318de52887caafd4a) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - fix(domains): verify a certificate actually landed on the exact hostname before forcing HTTPS or reporting success, and TLS-probe the domain afterwards so a mismatched certificate (e.g. shadowed by another zone's wildcard) warns instead of printing a broken "Live at" URL

- [#152](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/152) [`81f9e4d`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/81f9e4dc2ea5edbb82b410a0bda05834e3eca7ca) Thanks [@jedisct1](https://github.com/jedisct1)! - Prevent JSON output from being truncated when piped.

- [#143](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/143) [`8884779`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/88847797d2216b5cf23ae3e335a7ea2becb3fd95) Thanks [@jedisct1](https://github.com/jedisct1)! - fix(sandbox): let cp copy into an existing remote directory without a trailing slash. The SDK gains a public `sandbox.stat(path)` method, and `bunny sandbox cp` now checks the destination on both sides: an existing directory (or a trailing slash) keeps the source filename instead of failing with "Failed to write".

- [#145](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/145) [`654fb29`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/654fb2992a64e32686cbdd3d45d0e6d51a8846a9) Thanks [@jedisct1](https://github.com/jedisct1)! - chore(sandbox): install uv in the sandbox image and add /workplace/bin to the PATH

- [#159](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/159) [`36e145f`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/36e145f2f98358c0fd66e7e06046be156ca2b936) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - feat(sites): `sites deployments delete <id>` deletes a single deploy — its preview zone, files, and record — for CI cleanup of a closed PR's preview; the live deploy and the rollback target are refused, and deleting an already-gone ID is a no-op success

- [#149](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/149) [`19aec86`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/19aec86d94bff28a96d7649318de52887caafd4a) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - feat(sites): every deploy gets its own preview pull zone (`sites-dpl-<id>-<suffix>.b-cdn.net`) with instant HTTPS and no custom domain or DNS setup; publishing is explicit via `--production` (the interactive first deploy offers it), custom domains become production-only, and prune/delete clean up preview zones

- [#169](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/169) [`ef246eb`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/ef246ebceeec313445667c6fdc936c2b0bdbd5a7) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - storage zones surface tier and S3 support: Tier/S3 columns on `list`, both reported by `show`, and `add` prompts for them (`--tier hdd|ssd`, `--s3`) then offers to link the directory, show HTTP API, FTP, or S3 connection details, and save them to `.env`; `zones credentials` gains the same `--connection http|ftp|s3` picker with a docs link per protocol, `--format sdk` for a ready-to-paste `@bunny.net/storage-sdk` snippet alongside the rclone, aws, s3cmd, and env configs, and its own `.env` follow-up

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- [#100](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/100) [`8b8adb4`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/8b8adb486046513c5921daa06ee6befe9c221334) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - add bunny.net container registry support

- [#142](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/142) [`30686ef`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/30686ef9482c6191ea9b8ae839334ab8e4d9f436) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - feat(sites): custom domains unlock `dpl-{id}.preview.{domain}` preview deploys; domainless sites deploy straight to production

## 0.11.1

### Patch Changes

- [#140](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/140) [`f4b1486`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/f4b1486607d52d45fed345927dab72ffd00d861f) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - fix(sites): redirect extensionless directory paths to their slash URL in the router

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- [#125](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/125) [`9696434`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/96964348d630df5b8344087deac50bb6da4a5734) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - feat(sites): new `bunny sites` namespace for static-site hosting. `sites create` provisions a storage zone + pull zone + middleware router per site (zones are named `sites-<name>-<random id>` so globally-taken names can't block the create; commands take the clean site name), prompting for the name (directory-name suggestion) and a custom domain when run interactively (Bunny DNS record, nameserver guidance, DNS wait + SSL); `sites deploy` uploads immutable deploys (git-sha or content-hash IDs, no-op when unchanged) to preview URLs, and `--production`/`--prod` publishes the live site by flipping the router's `CURRENT_DEPLOY` env var + purging the cache; `sites deployments list/publish/prune` cover rollback and cleanup; `sites domains` attaches custom domains plus a `*.preview.<domain>` wildcard for per-deploy preview URLs; `sites ci init` (also offered by `sites create` on GitHub repos) scaffolds a GitHub Actions workflow with framework detection: previews on PRs, production on merges to main; `sites link/unlink/show/upgrade/delete` round out the lifecycle. Concurrent deploys merge remote state records instead of overwriting. Site state lives at `_bunny/site.json` inside the storage zone (403-blocked by the router). The shared hostnames factory gains optional `onAdded`/`onRemoved` hooks.

- [#135](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/135) [`009d9e8`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/009d9e812fe7f1f9088f1feb24743002cdf317ef) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - fix(sites): `ci init` now writes `sites.dir` and `sites.build` from `bunny.jsonc` into the generated workflow, so CI stops deploying the framework preset's directory while a local `sites deploy` uses the configured one; a `bunny.jsonc` below the repo root also gets a job working directory, a prefixed deploy directory, and its own lockfile as the cache path

- [#135](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/135) [`009d9e8`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/009d9e812fe7f1f9088f1feb24743002cdf317ef) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - fix(sites): `delete`, `deployments publish/prune` and `domains remove` now error with a `--force` hint when there's no TTY to answer their confirmation, instead of hanging on a prompt (and writing it to stdout ahead of `--output json`)

- [#135](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/135) [`009d9e8`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/009d9e812fe7f1f9088f1feb24743002cdf317ef) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - fix(sites): `create` falls back to `sites.name` from `bunny.jsonc` like every other sites command, instead of failing with "Site name is required." in a configured project when it can't prompt

- [#135](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/135) [`009d9e8`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/009d9e812fe7f1f9088f1feb24743002cdf317ef) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - fix(sites): `--force` on `delete`, `deployments publish/prune` and `domains remove` now errors without an explicit or linked site instead of opening the picker, so a highlighted site can't be acted on with the confirmation already skipped

- [#135](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/135) [`009d9e8`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/009d9e812fe7f1f9088f1feb24743002cdf317ef) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - fix(sites): `--link` is now only accepted by the commands that can act on it (`deploy`, `show`, `deployments list/publish`, `upgrade-router`, `ci init`), where an explicit `--link` also links a site resolved from `--site` or `bunny.jsonc`, including under `--output json`; `open`, `ssl`, `delete` and `deployments prune` no longer advertise a flag they ignored

- [#135](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/135) [`009d9e8`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/009d9e812fe7f1f9088f1feb24743002cdf317ef) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - fix(sites): `deployments prune --keep` now rejects non-integer and negative counts up front; `--keep abc` reached the pruner as NaN and deleted every deploy except the live and previous ones

- [#135](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/135) [`009d9e8`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/009d9e812fe7f1f9088f1feb24743002cdf317ef) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - fix(sites): `deployments prune` takes the site as a positional (`prune my-site`) like its sibling subcommands, instead of rejecting it as an unknown argument; `--site` keeps working

- [#120](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/120) [`3c3373a`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/3c3373a0dff5a0e730f7a6c3b5a23fb17727a14e) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - fix(storage): shared TTY detection, non-interactive guard and cancel handling for zones update, aligned --force semantics, and linked-zone fallback for domains commands

- [#120](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/120) [`3c3373a`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/3c3373a0dff5a0e730f7a6c3b5a23fb17727a14e) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - fix(storage): type-to-confirm zone deletion, new storage unlink command, offer-to-link from the zone picker, and the replication confirmation now defaults to no

- [#134](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/134) [`ac867d5`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/ac867d58f329575f89c52fa1d789c10501c4ef5b) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - storage: `--force` on `zones remove` and `files remove` now errors without an explicit or linked zone instead of opening the picker

- [#120](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/120) [`3c3373a`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/3c3373a0dff5a0e730f7a6c3b5a23fb17727a14e) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - fix(storage): canonical plural command paths in hints, consistent decline handling in zones add, and --custom-404-path "" now clears the custom 404

- [#128](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/128) [`f6b64a3`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/f6b64a3a414aefe059fbcf1ec6b0003b0dd1d04d) Thanks [@amir-at-bunny](https://github.com/amir-at-bunny)! - Sandbox is now visible on the CLI root help and landing page, with create examples in the README and root help. The backing Magic Containers app is now named `sandbox-<name>` so sandboxes are recognizable in the MC dashboard; default generated sandbox names dropped their `sandbox-` prefix accordingly.

### Minor Changes

- [#122](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/122) [`27a1929`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/27a1929c0e3b8973c2c11cf4e19dba9f3360c43a) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - feat(sandbox): add `bunny sandbox files list` (alias: `ls`) to list files in a sandbox directory over SFTP (bare name lists `/workplace`, or `<sandbox>:<path>`), and `--timeout` on `bunny sandbox exec` to close the SSH connection and exit 124 after N seconds.

### Patch Changes

- [#122](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/122) [`27a1929`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/27a1929c0e3b8973c2c11cf4e19dba9f3360c43a) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - feat(sandbox): add `bunny sandbox cp` to copy files between your machine and a sandbox over SFTP (`<sandbox>:<path>` on either side). Uploads preserve the local file mode; a trailing slash or existing directory keeps the source filename.

- [#122](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/122) [`27a1929`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/27a1929c0e3b8973c2c11cf4e19dba9f3360c43a) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - fix(sandbox): `sandbox exec` now honors the documented `-- <command>` separator, and a repeatable `--env` flag no longer greedily swallows the command that follows it

- [#124](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/124) [`9e31add`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/9e31add7c64acdf9b31b60ac149598e80715e670) Thanks [@jedisct1](https://github.com/jedisct1)! - fix(sandbox): verify a sandbox's SSH host key before sending a token, pinning it in a known-hosts store to prevent credential disclosure to an impersonating server

- [#118](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/118) [`93ffdbc`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/93ffdbc2de1833d144d4b0e4ce1f31184d28cf1a) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - fix(dns): offer Pull zone/Script ID instead of Value for link records in the records update editor, and pre-select the current CAA tag

## 0.9.0

- [#111](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/111) [`87e2c3d`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/87e2c3d7f8021bece3a27fe371fa5d710a7cdb8e) Thanks [@amir-at-bunny](https://github.com/amir-at-bunny)! - feat(sandbox): add environment variable support
  - SDK: `Sandbox` gains `getEnv`/`setEnv`/`unsetEnv` to read and persist container env vars after creation (merges with the existing set, preserves reserved keys).
  - CLI: `sandbox create`, `sandbox exec`, and `sandbox ssh` accept `-e/--env KEY=VALUE` (repeatable) and `--env-file`. Vars on `create` are persisted; on `exec`/`ssh` they are temporary for that invocation.
  - CLI: new `sandbox env` namespace (`set`/`list`/`delete`) to manage persisted env vars.

- [#98](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/98) [`4aa8fbe`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/4aa8fbeecc5c69921abe43116a5f77ff69a178c4) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - feat(storage): add storage zone and file commands with S3-compatible credentials

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- [#99](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/99) [`6c05e7f`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/6c05e7f046c869dc71484a20231e7855b19d33f6) Thanks [@amir-at-bunny](https://github.com/amir-at-bunny)! - Add @bunny.net/sandbox SDK for programmatic sandbox create, file buffering, command execution, and port exposure; wire sandbox CLI commands onto it

### Patch Changes

- [#97](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/97) [`b122269`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/b122269a5f5523302bccccba383460703818ac75) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - fix(install): ship a baseline (non-AVX2) build for older x64 CPUs that crashed with "Illegal instruction" — the installer auto-selects it, and the npm wrapper falls back to it on SIGILL

- [#107](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/107) [`18645ed`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/18645edc7736eb5d88f1a8ec038993cc7d2deb12) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - feat(dns): import a domain's existing records when moving to bunny: new `dns records scan [domain]` (server-side record scan, multiselect, bulk-write) and `dns zones add --import` offer the same migration right after creating the zone; a bad record is reported rather than stranding the batch, and CAA flags/tag survive via corrected `DnsDiscoveredRecord` types in `@bunny.net/openapi-client`

- [#107](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/107) [`18645ed`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/18645edc7736eb5d88f1a8ec038993cc7d2deb12) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - fix(dns): label the bunny-specific record types with bunny's canonical codes (Pull Zone as PZ, Redirect as RDR, Script as SCR) across listings and pickers, group them under "Bunny" in the interactive type picker, and accept those codes (plus the spelled-out names) when parsing a record type

- [#107](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/107) [`18645ed`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/18645edc7736eb5d88f1a8ec038993cc7d2deb12) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - feat(dns): `dns zones add` now scans for existing records automatically, then offers a next-steps menu (upload a zone file, add records manually, or continue to nameserver setup) so you can fully populate the zone before delegating; `--import` imports scanned records without prompting and `--no-import` skips the scan and menu

- [#104](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/104) [`1aa67e0`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/1aa67e069adb3d1ec2bc6395414053c2da67e332) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - feat(dns): manage Scriptable DNS scripts (`bunny dns scripts` init/create/deploy/attach/link/list) with ambient runtime types in `@bunny.net/scriptable-dns-types`; `dns records add` offers a static or script-computed answer for A/AAAA/CNAME/TXT

- [#106](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/106) [`ff794c3`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/ff794c30ec0cfabc18e5222fda2273b5fe6aacbd) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - feat(dns): verify registrar delegation with a live nameserver lookup (instead of the API's NameserversDetected flag, which defaults to true on a fresh zone) across `dns zones ns`, `dns zones list`, and pull-zone setup; `dns zones add` and `ns` now give registrar-aware setup steps (registrar named via RDAP) and skip them when the domain is already delegated; add `dns records preset` with email, verification, and security presets (Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Zoho, Mailgun, Resend, Proton, Bluesky, DMARC, CAA, no-email) plus a preset option in the `records add` wizard; color table heads bunny orange

- [#102](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/102) [`b4c1bd9`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/b4c1bd9029a8ee296e14a65447c04a6144ec330e) Thanks [@nocanoa](https://github.com/nocanoa)! - Added bunny color to the table head and also the help overview.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [#94](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/94) [`e2def53`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/e2def537dee2e11c1a12d2b6e01c2e87d583e11e) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - feat(scripts): wait for DNS and enable HTTPS automatically when adding a custom domain

  `scripts domains add` gains `--wait` to poll DNS (up to 10 minutes) and issue the free SSL certificate once the domain points at bunny.net; interactive runs offer the same. `scripts create` and `scripts init` now offer a custom domain as part of the flow.

- [#94](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/94) [`e2def53`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/e2def537dee2e11c1a12d2b6e01c2e87d583e11e) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - feat(scripts): point a custom domain at the pull zone via Bunny DNS automatically

  When a custom domain added in `scripts create`/`init` belongs to one of your Bunny DNS zones, the CLI offers to add (or repoint) the DNS record for you — always after confirmation — then issues SSL immediately since the record is already live on bunny's resolvers.

### Patch Changes

- [#94](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/94) [`e2def53`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/e2def537dee2e11c1a12d2b6e01c2e87d583e11e) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - refactor(scripts): share a common script selector across subcommands

  `scripts` subcommands (env, deployments, show, stats) now use a shared selector, so they consistently accept the optional `[id]` positional and `--link` flag for targeting and linking a script.

### Patch Changes

- [#88](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/88) [`aa0f44d`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/aa0f44d1c2cca49d8ee7dba4ffd854f83c71f93b) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - Cancelling an interactive selection prompt now exits non-zero so scripts and CI can tell a cancelled command apart from a successful one. Previously `db link`, `db regions update`, and `scripts env remove` printed a "Cancelled." line and exited `0` when you aborted the picker with Ctrl-C/Esc, making a no-op indistinguishable from success. They now exit `1` (and emit a proper `{"error":…}` payload under `--output json`), matching `scripts link`, `apps link`, and the shared `resolveDbId` selection prompt. Declining a confirmation ("Delete?", "Replace?") still exits `0` — that's a deliberate answer, not an abort.

## 0.5.3

### Patch Changes

- [`acc5332`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/acc5332fa55b5fa766b8181eb8fba9a45edf4b13) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - fix(apps/deploy): pre-select detected Dockerfiles in the walkthrough multi-pick so plain Enter accepts them, and stop defaulting the follow-up "add a path?" prompt to yes when files were already detected

- [`acc5332`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/acc5332fa55b5fa766b8181eb8fba9a45edf4b13) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - feat(scripts/init): replace the misleading "How will you deploy?" two-choice prompt with a single yes/no "Enable continuous integration with GitHub Actions?". Both deploy paths (CLI and GitHub Actions) remain available either way — the choice now only controls whether the template's `.github/` workflow is kept. The `.changeset/` directory is removed from every template (bunny scripts don't use it). `--deploy-method` is replaced by `--github-actions` / `--no-github-actions`.

- [`acc5332`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/acc5332fa55b5fa766b8181eb8fba9a45edf4b13) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - fix(scripts/init): detect the user's package manager (bun, pnpm, yarn, npm) via npm_config_user_agent, template lockfile, and PATH probe instead of always running `bun install`; warn cleanly when none is available, and surface a notice when the chosen PM doesn't match the template's lockfile

The registry picked during the walkthrough is now reused for the build/push step instead of being re-prompted, matching the multi-container path.

- [#81](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/81) [`eab6e8d`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/eab6e8d4f0db1c02cc583bc254237cc837705d57) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - `apps deploy` no longer prints the "Previous image / To rollback" hint after a first-time deploy. The hint is now suppressed when there was no prior app, instead of leaning on a byte-equality check between the locally pushed image ref and the canonical ref the API echoes back (which can diverge cosmetically and accidentally trigger the hint).

- [#81](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/81) [`eab6e8d`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/eab6e8d4f0db1c02cc583bc254237cc837705d57) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - `apps deploy` now prints where the app is reachable once the deploy completes — an `https://`/`http://` URL for CDN endpoints and the public IP for anycast/public-IP endpoints, per container. Endpoints whose IPs are still being assigned show as "provisioning…" with a pointer to `apps endpoints list`. The reachable targets are also included in `--output json`. The success line now reads "Your app was deployed successfully 🪄" and uses the bunny brand colour for its success marker.

- [#81](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/81) [`eab6e8d`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/eab6e8d4f0db1c02cc583bc254237cc837705d57) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - `apps deploy` and `apps init` now detect Dockerfiles in monorepo subdirectories during the first-run walkthrough. When more than one is found you can multi-select to create one container per Dockerfile, and an "add another" prompt lets you include paths the scan missed.

  Thanks to @jedisct1.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- [#65](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/65) [`aa2f707`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/aa2f70729b1aba5dc781d762a160c52adbac4628) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - `bunny db show`, `bunny db usage`, and `bunny db list` now read the new integer `current_size_bytes` / `size_max_bytes` fields from the database API and format them locally, instead of round-tripping the deprecated pre-formatted string fields through a parser. Storage values are no longer subject to the precision loss from re-parsing `"20.5 KB"`-style strings.

- [#63](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/63) [`4be3c3d`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/4be3c3d6841a9e4679fb216e8ee083df873c9224) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - Internal: rename `@bunny.net/api` workspace package to `@bunny.net/openapi-client` for clarity. No user-facing CLI changes.

- [#65](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/65) [`aa2f707`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/aa2f70729b1aba5dc781d762a160c52adbac4628) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - Update OpenAPI specs and align CLI with new enum casing.
  - `database` spec bumped to `0.0.130`: adds `size_max_bytes` / `current_size_bytes`, deprecates the string `size_max` / `current_size`.
  - `magic-containers` spec bumped to `v1.9.19.0`: adds `/apps/{appId}/summary` and `/nodes/plain` endpoints, `DeleteApplication` is now async, and several enums (`ApplicationStatus`, `ApplicationRuntimeType`, `AddRegistryStatus`, `RemoveRegistryStatus`, `AnycastIpProtocolVersion`) switched to lowercase / camelCase values.
  - `core` spec: adds External DNS certificate request/complete endpoints and new Stream Video Library / Storage Zone operations; pull-zone and storage-zone list operation IDs renamed (`Index` → `IndexAll`).
  - `bunny apps list` now correctly maps the lowercase `ApplicationStatus` values (`active`, `progressing`, etc.) to display labels; previously a recent API change caused the column to fall through to the raw status string.

- [#61](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/61) [`73a2dd9`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/73a2dd95ae1d367ffd90a2ff65856fcce0ded739) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - fix(scripts): pass `--` separator to `git clone` in `bunny scripts init` so the template repo URL is always treated as a positional argument, hardening against `git` argv injection.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#51](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/51) [`c1896be`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/c1896be35be7808cde1c076a0a89bce54fa15a76) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - Add `bunny open` command to open the bunny.net dashboard in the default browser. Use `--print` to print the URL instead.

- [#50](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/50) [`2bcf964`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/2bcf96435193bf2bb119c804302a1978cbb252f2) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - Add `bunny scripts create` command
  - New `bunny scripts create [name]` command for creating an Edge Script on bunny.net without scaffolding a project. Useful when you already have a project (e.g. ran `bunny scripts init` without `--deploy`) and need a remote script before running `bunny scripts deploy`.
  - Defaults the script name to the current directory name, creates a linked pull zone, and links the directory via `.bunny/script.json`.
  - Flags: `--type` (`standalone` or `middleware`), `--pull-zone`/`--no-pull-zone`, `--pull-zone-name`, `--link`/`--no-link`.
  - Refactored `scripts init` to share the underlying `createScript()` helper.

- [#53](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/53) [`44b4788`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/44b4788381be351eb922ceb8bf17ea7dfe5d4832) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - Add `--repo` alias for `--template-repo` on `bunny scripts init` and accept GitHub `owner/repo` shorthand. When a custom template repo is given without `--type`, the script type now defaults to `standalone`.

  After a script is created by `bunny scripts create` (and `bunny scripts init --deploy`), the CLI now prompts to open the linked pull zone hostname in the browser. Declining shows a reminder to make local changes and run `bunny scripts deploy <file>`.

### Patch Changes

- [#58](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/58) [`db5b128`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/db5b128fac0bd87d6694141b7b475c4a65447f66) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - The "update available" notice now suggests the right command for how bunny was install

- [#55](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/55) [`ccfb7c1`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/ccfb7c100ba97e4f1bbb6c9b1912a5430fe89f85) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - Improve the `install.sh` shell installer:
  - Default install directory is now `~/.bunny/bin` (no sudo required). Set `BUNNY_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin` to keep the previous behaviour.
  - On macOS, the installer now clears the `com.apple.quarantine` xattr and ad-hoc codesigns the binary so Gatekeeper allows execution on first run (fixes "killed: 9" on Apple Silicon).
  - Resolving the latest version no longer calls `api.github.com` (rate-limited to 60 req/hr); it uses GitHub's `releases/latest/download` redirect instead.
  - The script now warns if a legacy `bunny` binary is still present at `/usr/local/bin/bunny`, since depending on PATH order it may shadow the new install. Remove it with `sudo rm /usr/local/bin/bunny`.

- [#57](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/57) [`f22b6cb`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/f22b6cb4a5278021544cff3c7962d2a4310f8874) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - Fix `bunny --version` failing with "Unknown argument: version". The
  update-check work in a previous release switched yargs to `.version(false)`
  plus a manual `--version` option, which interacts badly with strict mode.
  The `--version` flag is now intercepted before yargs parses, so the latest
  version is still fetched and an upgrade hint shown when outdated.

- [#56](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/56) [`72cf2a8`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/72cf2a818a432a16d1807c19420d685c864a41dd) Thanks [@nocanoa](https://github.com/nocanoa)! - Added bunny.net ASCII art.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#44](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/44) [`87d76e1`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/87d76e131a85a1419f0ebc05abb400e396c1fc5a) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - Add `bunny db link` and lifecycle integration for `.bunny/database.json`
  - New `bunny db link [database-id]` command that writes `{ id, name }` to `.bunny/database.json`. Subsequent `db` commands resolve the target without needing `BUNNY_DATABASE_URL` in `.env`.
  - Database ID resolution order is now: explicit argument → `.bunny/database.json` → `BUNNY_DATABASE_URL` in `.env` → interactive prompt. The resolver also returns the database name when known, so commands like `db tokens create` can show `Database: <name> (<id>) (from ...)` without an extra API call.
  - `bunny db create` now offers to link the new database to the current directory, generate an auth token, and save credentials to `.env`. Three new flags make these phases non-interactive: `--link`/`--no-link`, `--token`/`--no-token`, `--save-env`/`--no-save-env`. In `--output json` mode, prompts are suppressed entirely — flags are the only way to opt in. The JSON output gains `linked`, `token`, and `saved_to_env` fields.
  - `bunny db delete` now removes `.bunny/database.json` automatically when it points at the deleted database, so subsequent commands don't try to resolve a dead ID.

### Patch Changes

- [#49](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/49) [`61e1518`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/61e1518df6e24dcfc62ac5ef4c299b53a9275ebf) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - Harden `bunny db studio` against LAN, cross-origin, and credential-persistence attacks
  - The studio HTTP server now binds to `127.0.0.1` instead of every interface, so LAN peers, container bridges, and VPC siblings can no longer reach it.
  - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` and the `OPTIONS` preflight branch were removed. The SPA is same-origin (Vite proxies `/api` in dev; prod serves the SPA and API from the same port), so no cross-origin grant is needed. Evil pages loaded in another tab can no longer read the API.
  - Added a Host header allowlist (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`). Requests with any other Host are rejected with `403`, which blocks DNS-rebinding even if the server is reachable via a non-loopback address.
  - The API is now gated behind a per-startup session token. The auto-opened URL carries `?token=…` once; the client exchanges it for an HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict cookie via `POST /api/auth` and scrubs the token from the URL. Every other `/api/*` request requires the cookie (timing-safe compare) or returns `401`.
  - `db studio` now prints a warning and prompts for confirmation before starting, explaining that a full-access libsql token will be minted and loaded into a browser tab. A `--force`/`-f` flag skips the prompt for CI and agents.
  - The libsql token minted on each run now expires after 30 minutes instead of never. This bounds the blast radius if the token ever leaves the developer's machine.

- [#49](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/49) [`61e1518`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/61e1518df6e24dcfc62ac5ef4c299b53a9275ebf) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - Harden the `bunny login` loopback callback server
  - Every response (success and error) now sets `Cache-Control: no-store`, so browsers don't persist the `?state=…&apiKey=…` URL to disk cache.
  - Non-`GET` requests to `/callback` now return `405 Method Not Allowed` with an `Allow: GET` header instead of falling through and attempting to read query parameters.

## 0.2.8

### Patch Changes

- [#40](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/40) [`1b77eea`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/1b77eeae362f442c1a3f920d70456c0911b69294) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - fix `db studio` for table and column names containing spaces

  The studio API rejected any identifier that didn't match
  `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`, returning a 400 "Invalid table name" for
  tables or columns with spaces. Replaced the validation with safe
  double-quote identifier escaping so any SQLite-valid name works.

- [#42](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/42) [`3cd013d`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/3cd013dc0b3cfad3d49e0327ee81d181b6b8720f) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - improve `db studio` error handling

  A single broken table used to cause cascading UI problems:
  - `/api/tables` would 500 if any one table's row count failed, locking
    users out of the sidebar entirely. The endpoint now isolates per-table
    errors and returns a `null` row count for just the broken table.
  - The client's `fetch` wrapper now surfaces the server's `error` body in
    the thrown message instead of a bare `API error: 500`.
  - `TableView` now shows an error screen with a Retry button when a table
    fails to load, instead of silently rendering an empty half-initialized
    view. Refresh failures keep stale data visible with an inline banner.

## 0.2.7

### Patch Changes

- [`72759e7`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/72759e772dc5ca2810e59eb6ba8d5703633de398) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - embed studio assets in compiled CLI binary

  The database studio UI was returning "Not Found" when launched from
  the compiled binary because the static files weren't embedded in
  the executable. Studio assets are now bundled via Bun's file
  embedding at compile time.
